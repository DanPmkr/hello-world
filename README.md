# hello-world

My name is Dan and I am taking a refresher course on Github.

I like javascript, python and everything about its stack.

This course gives the basics of creating repositories, working on such projects either alone or with a team and more

Fun Stuff always happen on **Github**

Hereâ€™s what I accomplished after this tutorial:

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request
